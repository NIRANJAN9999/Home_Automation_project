# üè† Home Automation Project Using ESP8266 and 4channel Relay

This home automation project demonstrates how to control household appliances using an ESP8266 NodeMCU and a 4-channel relay module. The system connects to Wi-Fi and enables remote control of devices (like a light bulb) via a smartphone or voice commands using Google Assistant. Manual switches are also integrated for local control.

## ‚ö° Project Overview

This project controls a 230V AC light bulb using a relay, triggered by the ESP8266. I initially attempted the setup using the Arduino IDE, Blynk, and KME tools, but encountered multiple issues. After several trials and errors, I found a working solution using a prebuilt firmware and the **Cadio flash tool** (version 3.9.8), which I discovered through a YouTube tutorial.
